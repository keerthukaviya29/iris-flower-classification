# iris-flower-classification
Machine Learning project for classifying Iris flower species.

The Iris Flower Classification project is a comprehensive machine learning application designed to accurately predict the species of Iris flowers using sepal and petal measurements. This classic dataset, widely used in statistical learning and pattern recognition, consists of 150 samples representing three distinct species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each record includes four essential numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The objective of this project is to explore, analyze, and model these features using supervised learning techniques to build a robust classifier capable of distinguishing between the three species.

The project begins by loading the Iris dataset through Scikit-learn and organizing it into a structured Pandas DataFrame. Comprehensive exploratory data analysis is performed to understand feature distributions, detect patterns, and observe how measurements vary across species. Visual tools such as pairplots and correlation heatmaps are utilized to highlight relationships, separability, and feature significance within the dataset. These insights help in validating model readiness and selecting appropriate algorithms.

Following the analysis phase, the dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate generalization performance. A Decision Tree Classifier is then trained to learn the underlying relationships between features and species labels. This model is chosen for its interpretability and its ability to capture complex, non-linear boundaries in the data. Model evaluation includes calculating the accuracy score and generating a confusion matrix to assess how effectively the classifier distinguishes between the three species. Additionally, a feature importance plot is generated to identify which measurements contribute most strongly to the classification decision, offering valuable understanding of the predictive power of each attribute.

Overall, this project demonstrates the complete workflow of a supervised machine learning solution—from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization. It showcases proficiency in Python, data analysis, and machine learning libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The Iris Flower Classification project serves as a strong example of applying scientific and analytical methods to build reliable predictive models and is well-suited for academic, portfolio, or internship submission purposes.
